## Image Spoofing

### To explore image hash spoofing open imagehashspoofing.md

Image spoofing is a type of cyber attack where an attacker manipulates or forges images to deceive or trick individuals or systems. This can involve altering an image to change its content, creating entirely fake images, or using images in a misleading context. Image spoofing can be used for various malicious purposes, including identity theft, spreading misinformation, or bypassing security systems that rely on image recognition.

### How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment for isolation purposes:
   ```bash
   python -m venv menv
   ```
3. Install the packages in the requirements.txt.
4. Ensure the main script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x main.py
   ```
5. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py 0x24 original.jpg altered.jpg
   ```

### Common Techniques

- **Photoshopping**: Editing images using software to alter their appearance.
- **Deepfakes**: Using artificial intelligence to create realistic but fake images or videos.
- **Contextual Misuse**: Using real images in a misleading context to deceive viewers.

### Prevention

- **Verification**: Cross-checking images with trusted sources.
- **Digital Watermarking**: Embedding information in images to verify authenticity.
- **AI Detection**: Using AI tools to detect manipulated images.

### Applications

- **Security**: Preventing unauthorized access using spoofed images.
- **Social Media**: Identifying and removing fake images to prevent misinformation.
- **Forensics**: Analyzing images for authenticity in criminal investigations.

Understanding and mitigating image spoofing is crucial in maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of visual information in various fields.

### Live Demo Approach

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py 0x24 original.jpg altered.jpg
   ```
2. Demonstrate prefix match:
   ```bash
   sha512sum altered.jpg
   ```
3. Show visual identity:
   ```bash
   display original.jpg altered.jpg
   ```
