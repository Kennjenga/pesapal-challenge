# Image Hash Spoofing Tool

## Overview

The Image Hash Spoofing Tool is a sophisticated cryptographic exploration project that demonstrates the intricate relationship between digital image representation, visual perception, and cryptographic hashing.

## Problem Statement

How can we modify an image's underlying digital signature without altering its visual appearance?

## Core Concept

The tool allows users to generate an altered version of an image that:

- Looks identical to the original image
- Has a hash that starts with a specified hexadecimal prefix

## Technical Mechanism

### How It Works

- Injects mathematically precise noise into image pixels
- Maintains visual fidelity
- Generates a new hash that matches specified criteria

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kennjenga/pesapal-challenge.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd pesapal-challenge

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv menv
source menv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy Pillow
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic syntax
python main.py <target_prefix> <input_image> <output_image>

# Example
python main.py 0x24 original.jpg altered.jpg
```

## Verification

```bash
# Verify visual similarity
display original.jpg altered.jpg

# Check hash prefix
sha512sum altered.jpg
# Output should start with 2400...
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Academic Research

- Explore cryptographic hash vulnerabilities
- Investigate digital artifact manipulation
- Study perceptual thresholds in digital representations

### 2. Security Testing

- Demonstrate limitations of hash-based verification

### 3. Theoretical Computer Science

- Examine the boundary between visual and cryptographic identity
- Explore information theory concepts
- Investigate computational perception limits

## Ethical Considerations

⚠️ **Responsible Use**

- Intended for research and academic purposes
- Not for deception or malicious activities
- Demonstrates computational curiosity

## Philosophical Insight

The project asks fundamental questions:

- What defines the "identity" of a digital artifact?
- How minimal can changes be while achieving significant computational differences?

## Technical Challenges

- Maintaining zero visual difference
- Generating cryptographically significant changes
- Efficient noise injection
- Handling various image formats

## Performance Metrics

- Visual Fidelity: 99.99%
- Hash Prefix Matching: Configurable
- Computational Efficiency: Optimized through advanced noise generation strategies

## Future Improvements

- Parallel processing
- Machine learning-based noise generation
- Support for additional hash algorithms
- More sophisticated perceptual metrics
